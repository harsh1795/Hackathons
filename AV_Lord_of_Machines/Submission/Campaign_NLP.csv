Hi,

DataHack Summit 2017 is going to be the largest and the most exciting data science event in India. This conference is aimed towards data science practitioners and focuses on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

It is a unique opportunity to meet the thought leaders & see the horizons of how machine learning & AI are changing the world around us. If you are leading Analytics / Data Science / Machine Learning in your organization, you have got to attend this.

Remember, what Mark Cuban said recently:
 
Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning  whatever youre doing if you dont understand it  learn it. Because otherwise youre going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.
 
Such is an impact of AI & ML. And if you need help to convince your manager on why to join DataHack Summit 2017, here is a nifty strategy:
